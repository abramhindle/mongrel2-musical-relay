=Introduction
* What if we could use familar interfaces to make music
* Could we co-opt other software and events to produce musical events?
* Could we even use web interfaces and use javascript UIs?

=Imagine
* Extending your spread sheet into a soundboard or drum kit
* Turning your paint program into a violin
* Sonifying a boring website like ebay
* Taking a flash game, a SVG program, or HTML5 program and using it as
computer music input.

=Lets Hijack Something
* JS1k (js1k.org) demos (now)
* Javascript programs (now)
* Websites

=What am I talking about
* Abram will now show a demo of filler creep sonified

=What was that?
* Javascript game using Canvas
* Instrumented to send XMLHttpRequests to a mongrel2 server
* Mongrel handler communicates to Harbinger
** Who munges messages, massages them and hands them to:
* CSound receives messages from Harbinger.

=Ok.. but how do we communicate from the Web?
* XMLHttpRequest
** AJAX
** Send a background request from a web ui
* Mongrel2 and Mongrel2 Handler receives it
** Pass off to Harbinger

=Harbinger
* send connectionless messages encoded in plain text
** UDP
* middle man routes these messages, and massages them
** Add code to the middle man to filter messages
* middle man passes messages on to other programs
 
=Why not OSC?
* OSC wasn't around or popular the time
* This is very simple
* This is very easy
* I can do more than OSC
* No errors if there is no one receiving the message
* Reduce dependencies.

=Guts and Bolts
* Let's get dirty, we're going to discuss and install:
** ZeroMQ
** Mongrel2
** HTTP Handler
** Javascript instrumentation

=ZeroMQ
* Fast messaging
* Wide variety of options
* \url{http://zeromq.com/}
\begin{verbatim}
wget \
 http://www.zeromq.org/local--files/area:download/zeromq-2.0.8.tar.gz
tar zxvf zeromq*gz
cd zermq-*
./configure && make && sudo make install
\end{verbatim}

=ZeroMQ
* Claims great cross language/platform network performance
* Asynchronous and easily event driven
** large message sizes supported
* Has perl support \texttt{cpan ZeroMQ}
** you might have to skip the tests
* We will come back to ZeroMQ
* Appropriate for local, cross-core, cross-interconnect and
cross-network communication


=Mongrel2
* \url{http://mongrel2.org}
* Based on popular ruby mongrel webserver
** Rails app server
* Aims to be a stable and fast webserver
* Not really general purpose IMHO
** meant for application specialization
* Seems fast to me 2.8ms response (1000 requests in 2.8 seconds in
perl) (beta0)
* Not totally stable yet

=Mongrel2
* Zed Shaw's baby and he seems to care about it.
* Too pythony right now
** Uses sqlite for configuration BUT the config examples are all
python and DSLish.
* Requires zeromq and a lot of python 
** Getting python packages sucks.

=Mongrel2 Config
* Control via m2sh, but first we need to make a config
\listpython{really-basic-config.py}

=Mongrel2 Routes
* Routes are the paths that you react to
\listpython{mongrel2-routes.py}

=Mongrel2 Handlers
* mongrel will listen on ports for the handler
** Need a send port 
** Need a recv port
* Handler needs an uuid ident (128bit)
* Our handler - the app
\listpython{mongrel-harbinger.py}

=Mongrel2
* Ok fine but how do we communicate with mongrel
** how do we serve an app?
*** handlers!
* ZeroMQ comes back, to communicate to mongrel you use json (yuck) and
zeromq (yeah!)
* Show http.py 
* Show http.pl 


=ZeroMQ and Perl
* ZeroMQ module
** Need a context object 
*** DON'T LOSE IT
*** Don't garbage collect it til you're done!
=ZeroMQ Perl Example
* \listperl{http_example.pl}
% {\footnotesize
% \begin{verbatim}
% my $sender_id = 'f8144414-ad7a-11df-9185'. 
%   '-001bfce70aad';
% my $sub_addr = "tcp://127.0.0.1:9997";
% my $pub_addr = "tcp://127.0.0.1:9996";
% my $cxt = ZeroMQ::Context->new;
% my $req_socket = ZeroMQ::Socket->new($cxt, 
%   ZMQ_UPSTREAM);
% $req_socket->connect($sub_addr);
% my $resp_socket = ZeroMQ::Socket->new($cxt, 
%   ZMQ_PUB);
% $resp_socket->connect($pub_addr);
% $resp_socket->setsockopt( ZMQ_IDENTITY, 
%   $sender_id );
% while(my $req = $req_socket->recv) ...
% \end{verbatim}
% }

=Mongrel2 http.pl
* Skip http.py because you don't need it
* Go through http.pl
* Show Mongrel2.pm

=Harbinger and Mongrel
* Now using Mongrel2.pm we make a handler
** To transmit messages to the instrument
** Show http\_harbinger.pl

=Javascript xmlhttprequest stuff
* You have to send messages back
\listjavascript{harb.js}
% \begin{verbatim}
% function harb(msg) {
%   var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
%   xhr.open("POST",
%     "http://localhost:6767/harbinger", 
%     true); 
%   xhr.send( JSON.stringify(
%     { "program":"filler", 
%       "id":666, "dest":"", 
%       "msg":msg }) );
% }
% \end{verbatim}

=Javascript xmlhttprequest stuff
* You might have to sample results instead of sending updates
** \texttt{setinterval(hardSender,100);}
* You might have to queue things up or split them up
* You might have to change mongrel settings to allow for 
  larger posts or gets

=Harbinger instrument
* Show example instrument
* demo example instrument

=Caveats
* Mongrel2 seems to be evolving quickly
* Bugs pop up and go away, so watch out
* There are lots of settings to fiddle with in the manual
** if you get strange behaviour maybe your buffers are not big enough.

=Future Work
* Fish or Cut Bait?
** Work on music
** Work on tools?
** Stream MP3s back?

=Conclusions
* Take home:
** leverage the UIs of other software to produce music
** Perl is the great glue that holds systems together
** Mongrel2 is fast enough for this job
** ZeroMQ is pretty interesting

=Garbage notes
* \lstinputlisting[language=sh,breaklines=true]{../mongrel-HOWTO.txt}
